    <h2>Themes & Style</h2>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Identity</h3>
      <p>Although Richler was Canadian by birth, he grew up in a Jewish immigrant community in Montreal, which shaped his idea of identity. His writing reflects a conflict between his identity as a Jew and as a Canadian. Many of the characters struggle with this duality as well, highlighting the tension between embracing or rejecting their Jewish faith. For example, in The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1959), Duddy is completely motivated by the desire to make a name for himself beyond the limitations of his Jewish community. Richler uses his writing to examine the complex nature of identity and how it is influenced by environment and ambition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Outsiders</h3>
      <p>The characters in Richler's stories are often outsiders or anti-heroes. They are typically incredibly ambitious, deeply flawed and oftentimes morally ambiguous. Richler uses these characteristics to question societal norms and to rebel against conformity. Through these characters, he explores what it means to succeed or fail on your own in a society that often demands compliance. Richler's early novels were not widely well received at first, in part because of his focus on the anti-hero. However, this concept later distinguished him and made his work authentic and genuine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Critique of Canada</h3>
      <p>Richler was an outspoken and controversial critic of Canada and its society. Many of his novels used satire to challenge the country and its culture. Being from Montreal, a lot of his writing focused on Quebec nationalism. For example, in Oh Canada! Oh Quebec! (1992), he exposed the Quebec sovereignty movement and their attempts to separate from Canada. He was also unafraid to speak on Canada's history, no matter how shameful or uncomfortable. Rather than using his work to flatter Canada, Richler hoped to use his critique as a tool to create a more inclusive and truthful society.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "card">
      <h3>Greed</h3>
      <p>The concept of greed is a recurring theme in Richler's novels. It is often the motivation for many of his characters' ambition. For example, in The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1959), Duddy becomes obsessed with acquiring land in order to become more successful than his humble beginnings. Unlike many authors, Richler doesn't solely portray greed as a human flaw, but instead as a necessary process to earn a place in society. Richler's portrayal of greed is used to critique the corruption and capitalist beliefs that are present in everyday life.</p>

Many of his novels achieved international acclaim as well and were later adapted into films. Richler's global appeal helped to carve out a space for Canadian voices in the world of literature. Over the years, his work has become an iconic symbol of Canadian culture, impacting humanities, education and political discourse.</p>
